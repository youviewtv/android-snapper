## Android-snapper
Android-snapper is a custom `RecyclerView` that provides 'centre-snap' behaviour:
  - The current item is displayed in the centre of the `RecyclerView`.
  - After a scroll, the item closest to the centre will be automatically scrolled to the centre.

Since `Gallery` was deprecated, there has not been a simple or clean implementation providing a centre-aligned/snapping list-type view outside of using a `ViewPager` with some margin tricks to 'peek' the pages either side (or the closed-source `WearableListView`). Android-snapper gives much more flexibility, allowing multiple `View`s to be visible and actionable on screen.

### Usage
You will need to subclass `CentreSnapRecyclerView`, which provides the abstract method `getChildWidth()`. This should return the width of each child `View` in the `RecyclerView`, as this is used in scrolling and snapping calculations. The `CentreSnapRecyclerView` should be provided with a subclass of `SnapRecyclerAdapter`, which is a `RecyclerView.Adapter` customised to work with Android-snapper.

### Sample
Android-snapper comes with a single sample app (under the `samples` package) which shows how to use the Android-snapper view.

### Version
